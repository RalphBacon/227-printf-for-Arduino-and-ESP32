### This is the LibPrintf library snapshot, September 2021. 
No, I don't know why it was put into a folder with a different name. Ask EmbddedArtistry!  

Do take note of the README.md file in the folder; it shows how you can reduce the footprint (memory usage) of this library by disabling support for various formats (eg float).  

Original can be found here: https://github.com/embeddedartistry/arduino-printf  
I recommend you download the latest code from there. This snapshot is here in case it disappears.  

As the author of this library states, "This code leverages the wonderful [mpaland/printf](https://github.com/mpaland/printf) library".
