# #227 printf for Arduino (and ESP32)
Formatted output in one easy-to-use line of code

Until now, the Arduino has not had the **printf** function, unlike the ESP32/ESP8266 which has it built-in.

Now you can ditch those awful **Serial.print** statements and start using a real C++ statement and make your code more readable, more maintainable and aesthetically more pleasing!

It's very easy to use and there's plenty of examples on the cplusplus website too:  
https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/

Arduino users will need the **library** (in the folder above) but ESP32 and ESP8266 users have it already built-in.  
The **demo sketch** that I used in the video is also included above, just so you can experiment a bit.
